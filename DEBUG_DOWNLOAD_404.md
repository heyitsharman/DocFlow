# 🔧 Download 404 Error - Debugging Guide

## 🚨 Issue Fixed: Missing Authentication Middleware

**Problem**: Download routes were missing the `authenticate` middleware, causing 404 errors instead of proper authentication checks.

**Solution Applied**: Added `authenticate` middleware to the download route.

## 🔍 Debug Features Added

### Frontend Logging
Both user and admin pages now have console logging for:
- Document ID being downloaded
- Download URL being called  
- Response data (when successful)

### Backend Logging
- Download route access logging
- Document ID parameter logging
- Admin download route tracking

### Test Endpoint
- Added `/api/documents/test` endpoint to verify auth is working

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. Check Authentication
Open browser console and navigate to documents page:
```
Should see: "Documents data: [...]" 
Should see: "Document Title: hasFile=true/false, fileName=..."
```

### 2. Test API Connection
Try visiting: `http://localhost:5000/api/documents/test`
- Should require auth and return user info if logged in

### 3. Test Download
Click download button and check console:
```
Should see: "Attempting to download document: [ID]"
Should see: "Download URL: /documents/[ID]/download"
```

### 4. Check Backend Logs
In the backend terminal, should see:
```
"Download route hit for document ID: [ID]"
```

## 🎯 Expected Flow

1. **Frontend**: User clicks download button
2. **Frontend**: Logs download attempt details
3. **API Call**: `GET /api/documents/{id}/download` with auth token
4. **Backend**: Logs route access
5. **Backend**: Validates authentication
6. **Backend**: Checks document ownership
7. **Backend**: Serves file if everything is valid

## 🚫 Common Issues & Solutions

### 404 Error
- ✅ **Fixed**: Added missing `authenticate` middleware
- Check: Backend logs should show route being hit
- Check: Frontend should log the exact URL being called

### 401 Authentication Error  
- Check: User is logged in (auth token exists)
- Check: Token is being sent in Authorization header
- Test: Try the `/api/documents/test` endpoint

### 403 Forbidden Error
- Check: User owns the document OR is admin
- Check: Document exists in database
- Check: Document has `hasFile: true`

### File Not Found Error
- Check: Document has `filePath` property
- Check: File actually exists on disk in uploads folder
- Check: File permissions are correct

## 🔧 Current Debug State

All debug logging is now active:
- ✅ Frontend download logging
- ✅ Backend route logging  
- ✅ Authentication middleware on download routes
- ✅ Test endpoint for auth verification

**Next Step**: Try downloading a document and check both browser console and backend terminal for debug output to identify exactly where the issue occurs!
